embers of the Army working at ‘Laya Leisure’ Kukuleganga recently carried out a community project at Baduraliya Primary Hospital and painted several wards after renovating them.
During the same project, they cleaned and tightened up the play ground for kids in the premises.
Brigadier M.A.R Gunasekara and the staffers at the holiday resort contributed to the project.
