A high-ranking Taliban official said the leader of the Pakistani Taliban, Hakimullah Mehsud, has been killed in a drone strike.
The strike targeted a vehicle used by Mehsud with 4 missiles in the north-western region of North Waziristan.
4 other people were killed in the strike, including 2 of Mehsud's bodyguards.
Several previous claims of his death, made by US and Pakistani intelligence sources, have proven untrue.
