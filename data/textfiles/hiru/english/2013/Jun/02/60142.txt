Thousands of civilians are believed to be trapped in the town, which lies close to the border with Lebanon.
The Red Cross says The battle for control between pro-government forces and rebel fighters has made medical supplies, food and water scarce.
Russia has also reportedly blocked a UN "declaration of alarm" on Qusair.
