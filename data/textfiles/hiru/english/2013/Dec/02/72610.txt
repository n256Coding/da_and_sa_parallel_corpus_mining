Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra has rejected protesters' demands that she step down, amid ongoing clashes in Bangkok.
Yingluck said the demands were not possible under the constitution, but that she remained open to talks.
More clashes broke out today as protesters tried to storm the prime minister's office, Government House.
