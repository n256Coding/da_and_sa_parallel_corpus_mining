Farmer protests continued in Hingurakkgoda town today too as there was no remedy found to the fertilizer shortage in the area.
Our correspondent said that the traffic was blocked on the main road as the protest continued near the Clock tower in Hingurakkgoda.
Protesters complained that they failed to obtain subsidised fertilizer stocks from Agrarian Service Centers.
Meanwhile certain Agrarian Service Centers sell fertilizer at higher prices.
A farmer said that the Sevagama Agrarian Service Center in Polonnaruwa charged him 1200 rupees per sack of fertilizer.
However addressing a media briefing held in Colombo today, UNP General Secretary MP Tissa Attanayake said that the government inefficiency has caused the fertilizer shortage.
