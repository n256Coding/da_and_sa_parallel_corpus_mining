President Mahinda Rajapakse has written to his holiness Pope Francis extending an invitation to visit Sri Lanka.
President in his letter said a visit by the Pope to Sri Lanka would be a momentous occasion to all Sri Lankans.
The invitation comes days after Pope Francis, at a press conference indicated that he may consider a visit to Sri Lanka as part of an Asian tour.
Sri Lanka and the Holy See established formal diplomatic relations in 1976.
Pope Paul VI visited Sri Lanka in 1970, and Pope John Paul II visited the island in 1995 to preside over the religious rites in the Beatification of Sri Lankan missionary Fr.
Joseph Vaz.
