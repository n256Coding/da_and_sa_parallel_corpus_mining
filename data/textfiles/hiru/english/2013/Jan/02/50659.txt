China is working on a draft for a law on international seabed exploration that would enable it to explore mineral and other deep sea resources in the Indian Ocean and other seas far from its shores.
The move is likely to worry New Delhi that keeps a close watch on China's strategic moves in the Indian Ocean with the help of countries like Sri Lanka.
Sri lanka recently supported increased Chinese presence in the Indian Ocean saying China needed to protect its sea trade routes.
The proposed law is part of China's efforts to build itself as a maritime power.
