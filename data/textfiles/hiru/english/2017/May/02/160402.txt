US President Donald Trump has said he would be "honoured" to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, in the right circumstances.
He said that if it would be appropriate for him to meet with the North Korean leader, he would - absolutely.
He would be honoured to do it.
The previous day he described Kim as a "pretty smart cookie".
The comments come amid escalating tensions over North Korea's nuclear programme.
The White House issued a statement following Trump's remarks, saying North Korea would need to meet many conditions before any meeting between the two leaders could take place.
