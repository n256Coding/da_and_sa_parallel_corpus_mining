A U.S. missile shield deployed in South Korea against China’s objections is now technically ready for operations as tensions grow over North Korea’s nuclear program.
The Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery set up in Seongju county more than 200 kilometers southeast of Seoul is able to respond to North Korean threats, South Korea’s defense ministry spokesman Moon Sang-gyun told reporters  in Seoul.
The ministry had said previously it expected the system to be fully operational by the end of the year.
Thaad is operational and has the ability to intercept North Korean missiles and defend South Korea, a spokesman for U.S.
Forces in Korea, said in a statement.
