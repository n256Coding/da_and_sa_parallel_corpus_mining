An initiative to sell coconuts for Rs.
65 each started by the Coconut Cultivation Board today (02).
The programme has been launchedÂ in Colombo.
And to avoid coconuts being re-sold, those coconuts have been painted with green and pink colours.
The Chairman of CCB, Kapila Yakandawela said they will sell coconuts at 40 locations including, Galle Road, Kesbewa, Highlevel Road, Katunayake main road, Rajagiriya and Gothatuwa.
