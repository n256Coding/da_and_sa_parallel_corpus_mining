Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa stated that the Uma Oya project was launched as per the requests of the people in Uva.
He expressed these views at an event held in Palaaruwa in Moneragala yesterday.
However, Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka stated that the Uma Oya project was launched by the previous regime mainly due to the need to supply water to the Former President’s hometown of Medamulana.
