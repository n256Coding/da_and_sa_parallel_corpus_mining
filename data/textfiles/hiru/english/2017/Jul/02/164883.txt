Revellers, police and some protesters have converged on Canada's national capital yesterday, for a party that has been years in the planning.
Canada is marking its 150th anniversary as a country in towns, cities and at backyard barbecues nationwide.
But the biggest bash is at Parliament Hill in Ottawa, where organisers expect hundreds of thousands of people.
And by mid-morning, they had turned out in their droves - albeit huddled under umbrellas, trying to avoid the rain.
The celebrations included a concert by Canadian artists, a display from Canada's aerobatics squadron the Snowbirds, a citizenship ceremony for new Canadians, and a massive fireworks display.
