Several water wells in Badalgama area in Katana have dried up, villagers complained.
They claim that a tube well constructed by a factory manufacturing carbon products in the area has caused the drying up.
Enraged villagers launched a protest against the factory yesterday.
The outcry has temporarily stopped the construction of other tube wells.
Factory management has agreed to discuss about the issue with residents tomorrow.
