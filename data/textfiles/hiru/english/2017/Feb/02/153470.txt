Railway Department has begun a special investigation with regard the Senkadagala Menike train that was plying from Kandy to Colombo getting disconnected at Pilimathalawa and moving ahead without compartments.
Reports say that while the engine had got disconnected from the compartments in the vicinity of the Pilimathalawa railway station, the engine drivers had continued on, up to the Kadugannaawa railway station without realizing they had been disconnected from compartments.
The engine and the compartments which were being taken for repair had stopped close to the Pilimathalawa railway station for about half an hour due to the disconnection.
