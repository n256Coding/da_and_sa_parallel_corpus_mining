All Lanka Motorbike riders union says that wearing of full face helmet has been banned by the gazette notification issued on 23rd  of last month requiring  motor cyclists to wear protective head gear.
At a media briefing convened in Colombo yesterday the secretary to the all lanka motorbike riders’ union Chiranta amarasinghe said that this gazette notification should be cancelled.
The secretary said that there was a danger that full face helmets would not be available for purchase during the next four months, since that specific head protective gear would no longer be imported into the country as a result of the said gazette notification.
