Attorney General Jeff Sessions met Russia's ambassador during the election despite telling his confirmation he had "no communications with the Russians".
The justice department confirmed he met Sergei Kislyak in July and September last year as part of his role on the Senate Armed Services Committee.
Mr Sessions said his comments at his confirmation hearing had related to his role on the Trump campaign team.
Claims of Russian interference in the election have dogged President Trump.
