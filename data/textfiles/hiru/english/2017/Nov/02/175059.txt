UNP Beruwela Electoral Organizer, Provincial Councilor Ifthikar Jemil says that the statement made by co- cabinet Spokesperson Minister Rajitha Senaratne, that the UNP and SLFP have arrived at an agreement to contest together for the Beruwela electorate, is a lie.
At yesterdayâ€™s Cabinet media briefing, responding to questions posed by journalists, Minister Senaratne talked about the Beruwela election preparations.
UNP Beruwela Electoral Organizer, MP Ifthikar Jemil noted that such a discussion was not held with Minister Rajitha Senaratne as yet.
