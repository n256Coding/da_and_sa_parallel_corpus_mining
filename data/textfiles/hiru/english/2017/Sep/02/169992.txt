A woman in Australia has died following breast-filler surgery allegedly carried out by a Chinese tourist.
Jie Shao has been charged with causing reckless bodily harm and using poison to endanger life.
The patient, Jean Huang, suffered a cardiac arrest after the breast augmentation procedure at the Sydney clinic she owned.
Shao was on a tourist visa and had only been in Australia for days before the incident, a court has heard.
