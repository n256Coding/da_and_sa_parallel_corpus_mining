Saudi Arabia has launched a massive tourism development project that will turn 50 islands and other sites on the Red Sea into luxury resorts.
It hopes to attract both foreign tourists and domestic visitors as part of efforts to diversify the Saudi economy, as oil prices have fallen.
Visa restrictions on foreigners are to be eased in the tourist zone.
However, it is not clear whether dress codes and other restrictions in the conservative kingdom will be relaxed.
