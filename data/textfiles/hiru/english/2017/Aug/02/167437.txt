Archaeologists at Cambodia's celebrated Angkor Wat temple complex have unearthed a large statue believed to date back to the late 12th century.
The 2m sandstone human figure probably functioned as a guardian who stood at the entrance to an ancient hospital, researchers say.
Angkor Wat is one of south-east Asia's most popular tourist destinations.
Last year the complex - which was built over different periods of the Khmer empire from the ninth to the 15th centuries - attracted about 2.5 million visitors.
But many of the complex's most valuable items have been looted.
