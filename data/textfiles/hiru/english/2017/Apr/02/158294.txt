Landslides have killed at least 206 people in south-west Colombia and left many more injured.
Hours of heavy rains overnight caused rivers to burst their banks, flooding homes with mud in Putumayo province.
The Red Cross said that at least 220 were missing, and another 202 were injured.
President Juan Manuel Santos, who travelled to the area, said troops had been deployed as part of a national emergency response.
He declared a state of emergency in the region.
