The Ceylon Electricity Board has proposed to procure 60 power generators to face the power requirement during any imminent power shortage resulting from prevailing dry weather in the catchment areas.
The water level of hydro power reservoirs have drastically decreased and, CEB has made this proposal to the Cabinet in order to avoid any possible power cuts.
Secretary of the Ministry Power and Renewable Energy, Dr. Suren Batagoda said the 60 generators with MW1 will be purchased for 6 months.
