Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday faced a shoe attack while addressing a public meeting here against demonetisation during which he targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The shoe, however, missed its target and the youth was nabbed.
The incident took place this evening when Kejriwal, the convenor of Aam Aadmi Party, was addressing 'Tijori Tod Bhanda Fod' rally against the demonetisation move.
