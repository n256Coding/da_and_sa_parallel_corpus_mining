Thirty-five Russian diplomats expelled from the United States by President Barack Obama have left the country.
An embassy official said the plane had taken off with all the affected personnel and their families aboard.
Obama ordered the expulsion in response to alleged hacking of the US Democratic Party and Clinton campaign during the 2016 presidential election.
President-elect Trump has promised a revelation about the allegations.
