Fifty Moroccan and five Spanish border guards were injured when 1100 African migrants attempted to storm a border fence.
The migrants were attempting to reach Spain's North African enclave of Ceuta.
Only two were successful, but both were injured scaling the 6m fence and needed hospital treatment.
One guard lost an eye, officials said.
The attempt comes after more than 400 migrants succeeded in breaching Ceuta's fence in December.
Hundreds of sub-Saharan African migrants living illegally in Morocco try to enter Ceuta and Melilla, Spain's other North African enclave, each year in hope of getting to Europe.
