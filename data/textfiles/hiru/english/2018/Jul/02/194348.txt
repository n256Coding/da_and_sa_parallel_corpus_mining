Left-wing candidate Andrés Manuel López Obrador has claimed victory in Mexico's presidential election, saying "profound change" is coming.
The ex-Mexico City mayor, known by his initials Amlo, is projected to win about 53% and his rivals have conceded.
He vowed to tackle the "evil" of corruption, saying it had caused social inequality and violence in the country.
He also pledged to double pensions for the elderly and seek friendly ties with the United States.
