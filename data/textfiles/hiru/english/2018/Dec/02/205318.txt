Another discussion will be held today between representatives of the United National Front and President Maithripala Sirisena.
Though a discussion was held throughout nearly two hours between the two factions, day before yesterday, no consensus was reached.
Meanwhile, the SLFP stated that President Maithripala Sirisena is expected to make a special statement on the current political situation at the SLFP Special Convention on Tuesday.
