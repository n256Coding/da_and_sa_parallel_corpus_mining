Information has been revealed that Homo sapiens of the pre historic era, dating back 1.6 million years had dealings with Sri Lanka.
Archaeologist Kalum Nalinda Manamendra Arachchi said that these information was uncovered in excavations carried out in Jaffna.
Several utensils had been found in a cave close to the shores.
Since these were similar to utensils found in Africa, there is belief that such pre historic species had arrived in Sri Lanka.
