Australian researchers say for the first time an entire city has been protected from viral disease dengue.
Captive-bred mosquitoes with a naturally occurring bacteria were released in the city of Townsville, where they mated with local mosquitoes.
By spreading the bacteria Wolbachia, which hinders dengue transmission, the city has been dengue-free since 2014.
Researchers from Monash University also believe their work could stop mosquito-borne diseases Zika and malaria.
