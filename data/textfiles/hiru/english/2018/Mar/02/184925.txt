About 25 people have been killed after a fire ripped through a drug rehabilitation centre in Azerbaijan's capital Baku, local media say.
Television pictures showed flames leaping through barred windows of single-storey buildings.
Four people were taken to hospital, and the blaze has now been put out, Azerbaijan's news agency APA says.
The cause of the fire is not known.
Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev is visiting the scene, local media say.
