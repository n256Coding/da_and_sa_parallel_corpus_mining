A group of depositors of the ETI Finance staged a protest at the firm's head office today (Jun 02) demanding their money.
ETI is a subsidiary of EAP Group.
The depositors charged that the ETI management is not taking steps to return their deposits.
They have already staged protests a number of times at the ETI office.
At every time, the depositors charge, that the management promises to repay the money, however, the promises are yet to be fulfilled.
Even today, they had failed to give a clear timeline to repay the money.
