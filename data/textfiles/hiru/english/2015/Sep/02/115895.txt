Millions of workers across India went on strike today in protest against Narendra Modi's economic policies, the biggest show of strength by trade unions since the right-wing Prime Minister took office.
They say labour law reforms planned by Modi's government will put jobs at risk that would make it easier to lay off workers and shut down unproductive factories.
All India Trade Union Congress secretary said the response had been "magnificent" and estimated over 150 million workers participated in the strike, although this could not be independently confirmed.
