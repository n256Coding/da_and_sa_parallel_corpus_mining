Customs apprehended a stock of satellite communication equipment and long distance remote control equipment yesterday.
That was at the Katunayake airport passenger terminal.
Reports say that this stock of equipment was found in the traveling bag of the leader of a group returning from a pilgrimage to India.
Customs media spokesman Leslie Gamini told our news team that it was illegal to import such satellite equipment without obtaining permission of the Telecommunication Regulatory Commission.
