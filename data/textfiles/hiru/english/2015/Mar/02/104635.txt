Former Minister Mahinda Yapa Abeywardana says the government is engaged in an attempt to win the forthcoming general election by slinging mud at opposition politicians.
He further pointed out the attempt to connect parliamentarian R. Dumindha Silva’s name to Wele Suda’s incident was similar to that of mudslinging schemes.
He made this allegation during a media conference held today in Matara.
