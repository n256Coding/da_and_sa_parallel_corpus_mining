The parliament meets this afternoon for the debate requested by the Opposition with regard to removing Mohan Peiris from the post of Chief Justice.
That was in accordance with a relevant request Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe submitted to Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa.
An argumentative situation arose in parliament last Friday as a result of the Opposition asking for a debate after Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe made a special statement in parliament with regard to removing Mohan Peiris.
While subsequently parliament was adjourned for 20 minutes, the house met again after 30 minutes.
On that occasion the Prime Minister had agreed to hold the debate concerned on February 5th.
However at the time parliament resumed session MP Dinesh Gunawardhana requested that the debate be commenced on Friday and at least one opposition MP be given opportunity to speak.
However the Prime Minister said that opportunity for the debate would be given on February 5th.
Although the Opposition requested for the debate on February 2nd, the Government rejected it giving Independence Day celebration rehearsals as the reason for the refusal.
Subsequently a heated argument took place between Government and Opposition MPs.
