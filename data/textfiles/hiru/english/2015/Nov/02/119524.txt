The Ministry of Public Administration has informed former parliamentarians to vacate the government houses in which they are currently occupied even after they lost their parliamentary seats in the last general election.
A senior ministry official told our news team that all former MPs have already been informed in writing they should vacate the houses within a month.
It is reported that 25 former MPs have not vacated their official residences by the end of last week.
The Public Administration Ministry has decided to take legal action if such MPs do not vacate their official houses by obliging to the ministry notice.
