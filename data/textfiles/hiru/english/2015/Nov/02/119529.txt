Australia Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has said Australia will no longer appoint knights and dames under the honours system.
Turnbull said the titles were "not appropriate" in modern Australia, and that Queen Elizabeth had accepted the cabinet's recommendation to drop them.
Former Prime Minister Tony Abbott reintroduced knighthoods and damehoods in 2014.
His controversial decision to grant Prince Philip a knighthood in January was widely seen as one of the factors which ended his term as leader.
