The White House says Russian air strikes against militants in Syria are "indiscriminate" and threaten to draw Russia more deeply into the crisis.
Spokesman Josh Earnest said Russia was carrying out random air strikes against the Syrian opposition.
Earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russia was targeting the same terror groups as the US-led coalition.
He rejected suggestions that Moscow was trying to bolster the Syrian military.
