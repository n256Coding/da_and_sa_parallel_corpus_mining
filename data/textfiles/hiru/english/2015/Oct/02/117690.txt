Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said at the United Nations General Assembly that Malaysia will open its doors to 3,000 Syrian migrants over the next three years to help alleviate the refugee crisis.
Najib said Muslim countries were partly responsible for ensuring the well-being of the marginalized Syrians fleeing their country in massive numbers, causing social and economic stresses in Europe.
It is reported that about four million Syrian refugees have fled into neighboring countries since the start of the civil war in 2011.
Najib said new international solutions were needed to deal with the migration crisis.
