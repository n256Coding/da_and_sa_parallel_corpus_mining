Nepal's authorities have ruled out the possibility of finding more survivors of last Saturday's earthquake, as the death toll has risen to 6,621.
Nepal said 14,021 people were injured in the 7.9 magnitude quake.
The fate of thousands of people in remote areas remains unknown.
The death toll in Nepal could go up as search and rescue efforts are still continuing in several hill districts.
