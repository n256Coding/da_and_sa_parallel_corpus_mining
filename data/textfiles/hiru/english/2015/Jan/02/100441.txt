Common candidate Maitripala Sirisena says that the publicity saying that it has been planned to remove northern army camps under his administration is a blatant lie.
At a function held in Colombo yesterday the Common Candidate pointed out further that this kind of false publicity had been concocted with Tamil and Muslim political parties joining to support him.
Meanwhile at a function held in Katana yesterday UNP national leader Ranil Wickremesinghe said that currently the countryâ€™s middle class was subjected to severe pressure.
On this occasion the UNP leader said that under a Maitri administration they would be rescued from such pressure.
