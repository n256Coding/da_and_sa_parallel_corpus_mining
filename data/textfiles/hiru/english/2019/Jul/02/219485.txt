The CID submitted a motion to courts yesterday with regard to investigations conducted into arrested Dr. Safi Siyabdeen.
The motion requests permission for 147 mothers who claim they have been sterilised to undergo the H.S.G test.
Previously the CID had requested for approval, however owing to the protest of lawyers appearing on behalf of the plaintiff, the court proceedings were postponed to 11th of July.
Meanwhile, during a media briefing held in Colombo yesterday MP Udaya Gammanpila expressed his views further regarding the matter.
He noted that a presidents commission should be appointed to investigate into this incident.
