Gavin Williamson has been sacked as the UK defence secretary following an inquiry into a leak from a top-level National Security Council meeting.
Downing Street said the PM had "lost confidence in his ability to serve" and Penny Mordaunt will take on the role.
The inquiry followed reports over a plan to allow Huawei limited access to help build the UK's new 5G network.
