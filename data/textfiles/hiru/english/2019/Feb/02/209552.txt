An arrest warrant on former Sri Lankan military attache, has been revoked without a court hearing following UK Foreign Office involvement.
The private prosecution of Brigadier Priyanka Fernando has degenerated into extraordinary legal confusion, forcing the chief magistrate, Emma Arbuthnot, to take control of the case.
Yesterday, she told Westminster magistrates court that she did not know how such a sensitive case could have gone to trial without it ever coming across her desk.
Brigadier Priyanka Fernando was filmed making gestures aimed at Tamil protesters outside the Sri Lankan high commission in London on 4th of February 2018.
