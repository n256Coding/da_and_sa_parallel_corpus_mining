Three kilos and 900 grams of Kerala cannabis have been recovered from a parcel that had fallen off to the road in the Manalkadu area in Jaffna.
This was during a search operation conducted by the Navy and the Police Special Task Force yesterday.
It is suspected that the owners had abandoned the Kerala Ganja parcel and fled due to this search operation.
