UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera stated that if the talks between the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) fail, the central committee of the party has decided to contest the next presidential election separately.
He was speaking at a press conference called this morning at the SLFP headquarters.
