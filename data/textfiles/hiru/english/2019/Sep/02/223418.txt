The head of the terrorist who attacked the Zion Church on Easter Sunday, presently buried in the Kalliyankadu Hindu cemetery in Batticaloa is to be exhumed today.
This is according to an order given by the Batticaloa Magistrate's Court.
The order was given after the Criminal Investigations Department made submissions to the Batticaloa Magistrate's Court on Friday.
Accordingly, the Batticaloa District Secretary has been ordered to exhume the remains of the terrorist from the present burial site and to identify a specific location suitable for burial.
The court issued the order following the protest in the last couple of days against the burial of the remains of the attacker of the Zion Church in the Kalliyankadu Hindu cemetery in Batticaloa.
