Australian Home Minister Peter Dutton said that 13 vessels carrying illegal migrants have arrived in Australia from Sri Lanka in the past 18 months.
He also stated that the Australian army had blocked an attempt made by a vessel to enter Australia carrying illegal migrants from Sri Lanka last month.
He was speaking to a newspaper in Australia after the Australian government took steps to deport a Sri Lankan Tamil family who had arrived in Australia during the war times seeking refugee status.
