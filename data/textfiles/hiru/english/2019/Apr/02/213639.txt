Gopi Krishaanthan de Silva , a Pharmacist from the Drugs Monitoring Authority gave evidence yesterday before the President’s Commission of Inquiry, regarding the fraud alleged to have taken place during the purchase of injections provided for the Maharagama Apeksha Cancer Hospital.
Consideration of the complaint had to be suspended as the witness fainted in the witness box while giving evidence.
Reports state that the chairman of  the President’s Commission had given a stern warning to the witness, as  he was not responding appropriately to questions being asked by State Attorneys.
The witness has been asked to re appear before the commission today to complete his submission of evidence.
