According to scientists in Brazil the mosquito-borne Zika virus may be even more dangerous than previously thought.
The scientists told the BBC that Zika could be behind more damaging neurological conditions, affecting the babies of up to a fifth of infected pregnant women.
Rates of increase in Zika infection in some parts of Brazil have slowed, thanks to better information about preventing the disease.
But the search for a vaccine is still in the early stages.
