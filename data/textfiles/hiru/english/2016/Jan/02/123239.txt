President Obama has said he will take unilateral action to tackle the problem of gun violence in the US.
In his first weekly address of 2016, Obama said he would meet Attorney General Loretta Lynch to discuss actions he could take.
He said he was using his executive powers as president because the US Congress has failed to address the problem.
Analysts say there will be a backlash from gun activists and Republicans.
