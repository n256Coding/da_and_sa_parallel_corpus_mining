The Queen has chosen Catherine (Kate Middleton), Duchess of Cambridge to take over from her as Wimbledon patron, for the Queen turns 90 this year and is in need to cut her work load.
The Duchess who has long been an avid player and tennis fan has attended numerous matches with Prince William over the years.
The Duchess of Cambridge, who often watches Andy Murray's matches at Wimbledon, accepted honorary membership of the All England Club in 2013, is expected to be named as its new patron during this summer's Wimbledon championships, reports international media.
