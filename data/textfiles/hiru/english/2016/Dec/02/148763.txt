School students and daily commuters for employment have been badly affected by the ongoing protest by private bus and three-wheeler unions.
Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) buses are deployed to curb the issue.
A large number of commuters are crowding at Kandy railway station to take the train as alternate transport.
Meanwhile, a SLTB bus on Trincomalee- Kandy route was hurled with stones last night.
Police said the incident took place near the public cemetery in Trincomalee.
The bus sustained damages but commuters managed to escape without injuries.
