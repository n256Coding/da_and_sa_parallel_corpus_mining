Bus commuters throughout the country have been inconvenienced as a result of the strike by private bus operators.
Protesters are protesting against the Rs.
25,000 traffic fine for seven road offences.
The Chairman of All Ceylon Private Bus Owners Association, Stanley Fernando said the strike has been successful.
Meanwhile, though the Lanka Private Bus Owners Association did not support the ongoing strike, Chairman Gemunu Wijeratne said bus owners of his association failed to report for duty this morning therefore their buses were not running.
When our news team contacted the Expressway Management Control Room, its spokesman said buses are not running on both the Southern Expressway and Katunayake Expressway.
