South Korea and Japan said they would impose new unilateral sanctions on North Korea over its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, following a fresh U.N. Security Council resolution imposed on the reclusive country this week.
North Korea has rejected the U.N. resolution, aimed at cutting Pyongyang's annual export revenue by a quarter after its fifth and largest nuclear test in September, as a conspiracy masterminded by the United States to deny its sovereignty.
Both South Korea and Japan already have comprehensive unilateral sanctions in place against North Korea.
South Korea also said it would ban entry from the South by foreign missile and nuclear experts if their visits to North Korea were deemed to be a threat to South Korean national interests.
