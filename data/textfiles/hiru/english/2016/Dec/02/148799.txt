UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has apologised for the first time to the people of Haiti for the international organisation's role in a deadly cholera outbreak that has killed more than 9,300 people and infected over 800,000.
"On behalf of the United Nations, I want to say very clearly we apologise to the Haitian people," he said three times, in Haitian Creole, French and English, to the UN General Assembly on Thursday.
"We simply did not do enough with regards to the cholera outbreak and its spread in Haiti ... We are profoundly sorry for our role," Ban said.
According to numerous independent experts, cholera was introduced to Haiti by infected Nepalese UN peacekeepers sent to the Caribbean country after the massive 2010 earthquake.
