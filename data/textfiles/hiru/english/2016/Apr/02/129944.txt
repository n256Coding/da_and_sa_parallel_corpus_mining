Government of Sri Lanka is soon to ink the controversial Indo-Lanka Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA).
But the question that lingers is if the agreement would be beneficial to Sri Lanka as much as it is to India.
Shredding light into the matter Engineer Gamini Nanda Gunawardena from the United Professionals Movement (UPM) believes that the state should be more open to the views of professionals in order to ensure that ETCA is not another failed agreement.
In an exclusive interview with HiruNews he says that Sri Lanka should open to other countries to be a serious global player, but must do it in the right way.
