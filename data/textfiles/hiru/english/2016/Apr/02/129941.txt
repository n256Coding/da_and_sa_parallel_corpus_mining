Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Harsha De Silva says that the statement made by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa that the present government has obtained loans amounting to USD 6.361 billion was incorrect.
He stated this at a media briefing in Colombo today.
The Deputy Minister also requested not to hinder the efforts taken by the government to repay the loans taken by the previous government.
