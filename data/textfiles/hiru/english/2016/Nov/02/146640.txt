Obamas celebrated their last Halloween at the White House on the 31st.
While handing out candy to children, President Obama encountered a pint-sized Prince, and he couldn’t help himself: He sang some “Purple Rain.” It was not, however, the Obamas’ only ’80s tribute moment of the day.
Barack and Michelle also gave a restrained performance of the iconic Michael Jackson “Thriller” dance.
Watch the Obamas take on MJ below.
