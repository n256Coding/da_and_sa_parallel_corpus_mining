Two persons have been arrested in connection with attacking an ambulance on its way to transport a patient during the joint opposition’s march.
The Peradeniya police arrested the two persons who are residents of Hindagala and Medabowala in Peradeniya.
Police said that the suspects who are aged 49 and 53 years respectively are scheduled to be produced at the Kandy Magistrate’s court today.
While there was a  vehicle congestion on the Colombo – Kandy Road with the kick-off of the protest march from Peradeniya on 28th last month, a group had attacked the ambulance passing the place.
However the police said that the action would be taken to arrest the remaining suspects using video footage.
