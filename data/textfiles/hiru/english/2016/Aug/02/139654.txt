Minister of Higher Education and Highways Lakshman Kiriella today said that the people's mandate is not with those who march on the streets.
Referring to the Jana Satana paada yatra which was concluded last evening, Kiriella said that the forthcoming Local Government Election will be the test which shows that the marchers do not have a mandate.
