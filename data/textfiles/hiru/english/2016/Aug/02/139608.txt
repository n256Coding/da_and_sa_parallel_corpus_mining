A Russian helicopter was shot down today after delivering aid to the Syrian city of Aleppo, killing all five crew members on board.
The Russian Defense Ministry said the Mi-8 helicopter was shot down by ground fire in Idlib province as it returned to base.
The helicopter downing comes amid deadly fighting in eastern Aleppo, where rebels are trying to break a Syrian government siege in the country's five-year civil war.
