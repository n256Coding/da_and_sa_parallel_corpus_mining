A world-leading air crash investigator has said he believes flight MH370 was deliberately flown into the sea.
Larry Vance told Australian news programme 60 Minutes that erosion along the trailing edge of recovered wing parts indicated a controlled landing.
The Boeing 777 disappeared while flying to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur with 239 people on board in March 2014.
The official investigation team has said it is investigating whether the plane was piloted in its final moments.
He was the chief author of a report into the 1998 SwissAir Flight 111 crash off Nova Scotia, Canada which killed 229 people.
The force of that crash broke the plane into more than two million pieces.
He told 60 Minutes that an absence of such wreckage was one factor suggesting MH370 landed in controlled circumstances.
"Somebody was flying the airplane at the end of its flight," he said.
"Somebody was flying the airplane into the water.
There is no other alternate theory that you can follow."
