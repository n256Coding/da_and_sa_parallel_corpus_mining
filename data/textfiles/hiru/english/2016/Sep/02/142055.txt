An 80-year-old mother of 15 from Gonewa village in Kallanchiya area, Mihintale shared her gloomy life story with Hiru News.
She has given birth to 15 children.
From them 11 are alive.
However, this mother is not taken care of by her children.
She lives in a makeshift house and eats what the villagers provide her.
She is waiting humbly till someone comes to aide her during this vulnerable age.
