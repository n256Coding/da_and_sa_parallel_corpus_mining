The National Water Supply and Drainage Board request the public to consume drinking water only for essential purposes.
The water levels of reservoirs in the Western, Southern, Uva and North-central provinces have dropped due to the prevailing dry weather condition.
The weather has also increased the water consumption among the consumers.
The water board further noted that water is supplied via bowsers to residents of areas facing water crisis.
Accordingly, the General Manager of the Water Board Asoka Kumararatne requests the public to consume drinking water sparingly.
