Bangladeshi forces have cleared the caf√© in Dhaka where militants held at least 20 hostages.
They say 13 hostages, including four foreigners, were rescued and six attackers shot dead.
However, the fate of other captives remains unclear.
Several of those held at the Holey Artisan Bakery cafe were believed to be Italian, and some may be Japanese.
The militant group Islamic State (IS) has said it carried out the attack.
