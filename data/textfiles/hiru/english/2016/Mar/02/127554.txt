Al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden has left a fortune of $21 million inheritance for jihad, his will shows.
Foreign media reported that the will was seized during the US raid in Abbottabad in Pakistan.
In the will Bin Laden has asked his family to ‘obey my will’ and spend the money on ‘jihad, for the sake of Allah’.
Bin Laden was killed by US Special Forces in May 2011 during the Abbottabad raid.
