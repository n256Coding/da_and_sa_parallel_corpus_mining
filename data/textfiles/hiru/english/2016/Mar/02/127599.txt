The JPV expects to file a petition with the Supreme Court soon requesting the Top Court to order the Government to empower the Paddy Marketing Board Act.
Chairman of the JVP affiliated All Ceylon Farmers Federation and North Western Provincial Councilor Namal Karunarathna stated this during a media conference held in Dambulla yesterday.
He further said that the ministry will be cordoned with the participation of farmers if their problems are not attended to in the near future.
