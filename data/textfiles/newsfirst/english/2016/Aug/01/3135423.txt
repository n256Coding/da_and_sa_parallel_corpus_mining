SLFP seniors made the following observations with regard to an incident where marchers in the Pada Yathra had jeered at the Party Headquarters on Darley Road.
Minister of Petroleum and Petroleum Gas, Chandima Weerakkody noted that he condemns the shameless behaviour of the SLFP.
He added that a majority of those in the joint group are not people who can be identified as being from the SLFP, as they are people who destroyed their own parties, and later joined with the SLFP.
He went on to note that SLFPers and the people of the country must understand the democracy that has been brought to the party under the leadership of Maithripala Sirisena, must be protected.
