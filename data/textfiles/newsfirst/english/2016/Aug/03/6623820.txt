A plane was forced to make an emergency landing in Dubai, according to officials.
The Emirates flight, which was en route to Dubai from Thiruvananthapuram in India, began to have problems just after midday local time.
Gulf News reported that all passengers are safe and that the area has been cordoned off.
The Dubai government confirmed the jet – which took off from India earlier today – had crash-landed at the airport shortly after 1pm local time (10am UK time).
