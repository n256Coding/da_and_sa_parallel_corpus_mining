Minister of Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Harin Fernando addressing a media briefing in Sirikotha on Thursday commented on the 65th anniversary celebrations of the Sri Lanka Freedom party.
The minister said: If they can listen to their own conscience, they will realise that the leader of the joint opposition who was shouting is not in the country, when their convention is about to take place.
He has left the country and has hid himself in Malaysia.
It is shameful if they still call themselves SLFPers.
What they are doing is creating the juncture where the SLFP will be destroyed.
