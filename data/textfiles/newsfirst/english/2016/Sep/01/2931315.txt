Construction work on yet another project under the Gammadda 100- Days Initiative commencedÂ on Thursday.
The project will provide sanitary facilities to Kusumpura Bodhi Malu Viharaya in Nochchiyagama.
The Kusumpura Bodhi Malu Viharaya, which has been under constructed for nearly years, is situated in a village which has no infrastructure facilities.
The key issue at the temple is the absence of sanitary facilities.
The issue mainly aggravates during Poya Days when devotees arrive at the temple to take part in religious observances.
