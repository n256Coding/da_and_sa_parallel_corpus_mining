Former Colombo Additional Magistrate Thilina Gamage, who surrendered to Court earlier this afternoon, has been released on bail.
He surrendered to court today (June 2) after Court ordered for his arrest over the alleged possession of an elephant calf without a permit.
The case is to be taken up once again on the 6th of June.
