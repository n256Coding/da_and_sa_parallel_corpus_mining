The Department of Irrigation has reached a decision to increase the height of the bund which run along the banks of the Kelani river.
Director General of the Department, Saman Weerasinghe said that 6 bunds including the main bunds separating land and river will be reconstructed.
He also added that a special pump system will be installed to drain water from low lying areas on either side of the river.
The measures are part of a new programme to control the waters of the Kelaniya river.
The director General of the Department of irrigation added that a detailed project report will be handed over to the President next week.
