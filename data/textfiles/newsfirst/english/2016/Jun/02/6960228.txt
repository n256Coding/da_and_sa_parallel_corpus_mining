France and UK have called on the UN to begin humanitarian aid air drops to besieged areas in Syria.
The International Syria Support Group (ISSG) set a deadline of 1 June for the distribution of aid but only a small amount of supplies made it to delivery on Wednesday.
The UN Security Council will meet on Friday to discuss the air drops.
British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond charged that the Syrian government had failed to deliver on the call for humanitarian access by the international community.
He further called on Russia and Syria, who are allied with the Syrian government, to use their influence to ensure the safety of the air drops.
