Private bus operators of the Southern Expressway staged a strike on Tuesday morning.
The strike has been staged as a mark of protest against the granting of permits for additional buses along the expressway.
Chairman of the Private Bus Owners Association Gemunu Wijeratne said that the permits were granted as part of an old tender.
