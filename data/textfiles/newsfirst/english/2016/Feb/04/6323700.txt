Plenty of leg room, personalised service and no crying babies or unruly fellow passengers, that was what one lucky traveller in China experienced while flying home to Guangzhou for the New Year holiday.
A Chinese woman heading home for the holidays had a commercial airline flight all to herself after gruelling delays winnowed down other passengers.
She documented her “happy” experience in a post on the popular Chinese micro-blogging platform Weibo.
She also received personalised service and attention from the flight attendants and pilot.
