The second promotional campaign of the first-ever Avurudu Mega Pola supported by Google, together with News1st, took place in the Nawalapitiya town today.
The general public will be able to make online orders from Google Mega Pola.
The event page will feature a host of consumer products and electronics at the most competitive prices.
A unique feature of the Avurudu Mega Pola will be the easy accessibility it affords to consumers located across Sri Lanka when ordering products.
In addition to shopping being just a click away, customers who order products would be offered all-island delivery and the option of paying cash on delivery.
The awareness programme on registration at theÂ Mega Pola took place in Nawalapitiya.
The programme will take place in Vavuniya on Sunday.
