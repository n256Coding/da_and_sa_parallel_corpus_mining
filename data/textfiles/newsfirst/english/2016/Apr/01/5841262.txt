During a media briefing held on Thursday, parliamentarian Dinesh Gunewardena cautioned against playing with national security.
He added that the government was warned in this regard for months.
MP Dinesh Gunwardena further noted that great threats will be at hand ifÂ  we failed to be cautious about national security.
He said: President has to refrain from thinking that nothing would happen if he is the state leader, because we are all ordinary people.
MP Gunawardena also emphasised that the opposition would like to to request the government to be alert, considering this as a great threat to national security, and the people.
