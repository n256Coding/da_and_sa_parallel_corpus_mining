Speaker Karu Jayasuriya appointed a four-member committee to look into the vote on the Supplementary Estimate that took place in Parliament.
Opposition Leader, R. Sampanthan, former speaker Chamal Rajapaksa, Minister of Justice President’s Counsel Dr Wijedasa Rajapaksa, and former justice minister Rauff Hakeem have been appointed to the four-member committee to look into the vote once again and submit a report to parliament.
