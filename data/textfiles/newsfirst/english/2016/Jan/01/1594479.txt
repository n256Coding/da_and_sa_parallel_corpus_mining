The authorities in Dubai are trying to find out what caused a spectacular fire to engulf a 63-storey luxury hotel in the city centre on New Year’s Eve.
Firefighters managed to subdue the blaze, but part of the Address Downtown Hotel is still smouldering.
The tower was evacuated and 16 people were hurt.
But a fireworks show went ahead at the Burj Khalifa tower nearby.
The Burj Khalifa is the world’s tallest building and an iconic symbol of the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
