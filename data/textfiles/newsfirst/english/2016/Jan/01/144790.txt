Starting Jan. 1, the production and distribution of polythene below 20 microns will be prohibited.
Chairman of the Central Environmental Authority Lal Dharmasiri said that this measure was taken after taking into account the environmental pollution caused by such polythene material.
He added that around 20 million polythene material is used in the country each day.
