Minister of Health Dr. Rajitha Senaratne explained reasons that have led to the delay in penalising the corrupt.
The minister said that they are constantly questioned on whether the rogues and murderers have been arrested.
He said that these matters come under the purview of the Attorney General Department and the Inspector General of Police.
The minister stated: We have to operate in a country where such an environment prevails.
We may have changed the government, but our state remains the same.
The minister made these remarks during the opening of the Rajya Osu Sala outlet in Karapitiya.
