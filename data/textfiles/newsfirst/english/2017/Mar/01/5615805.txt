A decision has been reached to halt admissions of disabled individuals into the allowance scheme paid by the government.
This decision has beenÂ taken due to lack of funds.
According to Minister of Social Welfare and Social Empowerment S. B. Dissanayake, allocations had not been made by the budget for this purpose, even though a request was made.
The Minister added that as a result of this situation, a cabinet paper will be drafted requesting for such allocations.
Minister S. B. Dissanayake stated that a disabled individual currently receives a monthly allowance of Rs.
3,000.
He further noted that an additional of 50,000 disabled individuals are yet to receive the said allowance.
