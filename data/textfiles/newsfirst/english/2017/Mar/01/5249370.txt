A 99 year old elderly woman named Annie from the Netherlands has an unusual bucket list wish, where she wanted to be handcuffed and locked behind bars.
As per Annie’s wish, she was detained and taken to the police station in the town of Nijmegen, where she was handcuffed and allowed to sit in a cell.
This was done as the officers received a request from Annie’s niece to help her tick her unusual wish off her bucket list.
