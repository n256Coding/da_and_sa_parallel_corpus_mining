Yesterday, Senator Parry revealed he had doubts about his citizenship status because his father was born in the UK, and emigrated to Australia in the 1950s.
His successor is likely to be Richard Colbeck, a former tourism minister under Prime Minster Malcolm Turnbull who lost his seat in the 2016 poll.
Australian Deputy Prime Minister, Barnaby Joyce, was also disqualified from office for holding dual citizenship.
