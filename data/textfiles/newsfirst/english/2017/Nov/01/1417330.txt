A 29-year-old man who emerged from the white pick-up truck was shot by a police officer and arrested.
The suspect is reported to have screamed “Allahu Akbar” after the crash, and that is a key reason authorities are looking at terrorism as a possible motive, sources said.
The suspect is from the central Asian nation of Uzbekistan and came to the United States in 2010 – CNN.
President Donald Trump tweeted: “My thoughts, condolences and prayers to the victims and families of the New York City terrorist attack.
God and your country are with you!” My thoughts, condolences and prayers to the victims and families of the New York City terrorist attack.
