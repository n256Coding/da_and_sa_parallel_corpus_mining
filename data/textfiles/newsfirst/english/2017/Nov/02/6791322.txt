The Supreme Court has rejected the ‘fundamental rights’ petition filed by Perpetual Treasuries Limited.
PTL’s  commercial licence to operate as a Primary Dealer of Central Bank was suspended for 6 months.
Arjun Aloysius filed in the petition, requesting that this decision taken by the Central Bank Monetary Board on July 6 be nullified.
The Attorney General’s objections were considered by the the Supreme Court bench, who then rejected the petition.
The bench consisted of: “There is no legal right for perpetual treasuries limited to file such a fundamental rights petition”, said the Attorney General’s Department.
