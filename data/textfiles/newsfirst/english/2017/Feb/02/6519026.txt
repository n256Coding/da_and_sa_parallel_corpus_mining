Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka,   on the Satana Political programme held last evening, made a startling revelation about another scam that took place under the previous regime.
According to the Minister of Megapolis and Western Development, three shipments of coal were imported to the country without informing him while a certain company connected to one of the sons of the royal family sent a satellite in to space.
