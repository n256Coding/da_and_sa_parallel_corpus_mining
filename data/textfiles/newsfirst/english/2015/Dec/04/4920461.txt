The prices of vegetables have increased in the Dambulla Economic Centre due to the decrease in the quantity of vegetables arriving at the centre.
Our provincial correspondent stated that the prices of vegetables have in turn increased as crops had been destroyed due to the heavy rainfall.
This situation has resulted in an increase in the prices of vegetables in the markets in the country today.
