Action will be taken from Tuesday, December 1,Â  against those travelling on the footboard of trains.
Superintendent of Railway Transport, Vijaya Samarasinghe says that the decision was taken due to the accidents.
The law will only be imposed on long distance trains and will not be applied to the office trains.
Although travelling on the foot boards of train carriages is an offence under the railways ordinance, as a result of their being insufficient trains to meet the demand of commuters, this law has not been enforced in the past.
