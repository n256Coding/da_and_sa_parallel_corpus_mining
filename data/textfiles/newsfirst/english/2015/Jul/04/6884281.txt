Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff has unveiled the torch to be used at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.
She said the Games would bring “honour and pride” to the country.
Organizers said the torch’s design was inspired by Brazil’s “nature, and the harmonious diversity and energy” of the Brazilian people.
The torch, crafted from recycled aluminum and resin with a satin finish, innovates with different segments that open up when the Olympic flame is passed from one torchbearer to another.
Ms Rousseff, who has seen her popularity plunge amid a serious economic crisis, says the country will rise to the challenge and will organise a safe and successful Games.
She said 12,000 people would be chosen to carry the Olympic torch through some 300 Brazilian cities next year.
The Olympics organising committee and sponsors will choose the torchbearers in the next few months.
The torch relay will begin in the Brazilian capital in May and will end at Rio’s Maracana stadium in August, at the Olympic’s opening ceremony.
