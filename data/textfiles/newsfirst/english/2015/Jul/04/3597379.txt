Addressing an event in Grandpass on Saturday July 4, UNP Western Provincial Councillor S.M.Marikkar said that the statement that was made citing that nomination will be given to the former president is suspicious.
He said that the General Secretary of the UPFA recently went abroad and returned and they are doubtful as to whether he went abroad to strike a deal and join with the group of Mahinda.
