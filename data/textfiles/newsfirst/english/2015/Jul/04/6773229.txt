Australia fast bowler Ryan Harris has announced his retirement from the sport because of a knee injury.
Harris will therefore miss the Ashes series and is replaced in the Australia squad by Pat Cummins.
The 35-year-old missed Australiaâ€™s final warm-up game at Essex before the first Test against England, which starts in Cardiff on 8 July.
Harris, who had surgery on his right knee last year, has taken 57 wickets at an average of 20.63 in 12 Ashes Tests.
