A three-month amnesty period has been granted to navy personnel who left service without following  proper procedure, to report back to work.
Navy Spokesperson Commander Indika de Silva said that these personnel can call on the nearest navy base and report to work.
He added that these individuals will be given an opportunity to leave the navy legally on the same day that they report to work.
The navy spokesperson noted that those personnel who are enrolled in various courses and those who have signed agreements with the navy will not be allowed to leave until they complete their due time.
