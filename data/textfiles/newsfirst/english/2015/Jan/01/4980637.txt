Deputy Leader of the UNP Sajith Premadasa expressed the following views at a meeting held in Hambantota on Wednesday.
[quote]I want to clearly state to you that we will end this journey in victory.
We will conceal this victory not merely for the privilege of positions .
The foremost goal of this victory is to nourish the people of this country.
Our aspiration is to create an era where the people of this nation will rise on their own feet without depending on another.
I very clearly state to you, there are many who are remaining in the government as ministers  and showering us their blessings.
