Microsoft will not launch Windows 10 for smartphones this summer.
The Redmond giant’s Corporate Vice President Joe Belfiore delivered the news at a Build media event in San Francisco.
As it turns out, Microsoft is focussed on launching Windows 10 for PC first.
Builds of the new OS for smartphones are said to be behind in their development compared to their desktop counterparts.
The above strategy by Microsoft should hardly catch anyone by surprise.
The company pulled a similar trick with the launch of Windows 8.1 – its variant for smartphones (Windows Phone 8.1) arrived at a later stage.
