The Voice Against Corruption questions as to why the investigations on the controversial treasury bond issue is not being expedited.
The organisation points out that this investigations needs to be conducted at the pace in which the Weliamuna Report was formulated.
MP Bandula Gunawardena said on Friday that a loss of Rs.100 millionÂ  is incurred daily as a result of the controversial bonds.
Convenor of the Voice Against Corruption Wasantha Samarasinghe says that with regard to the CBSL fraud that occurred recently, a committee of three loyalists to the PM was appointed by him by the request of the President to look into the fraud that occurred at the issuance of bonds from the Central Bank.
He went on to note that it has been three weeks since the committee was appointed but up until today the committee report has not come out.
