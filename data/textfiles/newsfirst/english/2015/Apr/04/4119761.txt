The JVP has warned that if the peopleâ€™s aspirations are not fulfilled, it will be the end of the present rulers.
JVP Parliamentarian Sunil Handunnetti made this view while declaring open the party office in Mapalana, Kamburupitiya.
MP Sunil Handunnetti said that the responsibility of the current President is not to provide ministerial positions to persons like S.B.Dissanayake , who worked to defeat Maithripala Sirisena.
He went on to note that people do not hope for that, adding that people hope for those who committed fraud and corruption during the previous rule to be punished.
