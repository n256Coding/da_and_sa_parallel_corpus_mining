At a meeting held on Wednesday, Western Provincial Councillor S.M Marikkar criticised the activities of Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
He said that a huge business campaign was carried out by a group to make Mahinda Rajapaksa the Prime Minister.
Provincial Councillor Marikkar said: Mahinda Rajapaksa is a good political dealer.
Now he is trying to create a political deal and stop the investigations against the individuals in their group, he is trying to show the power of the public through a deal with Maithripala Sirisena.
He added that he is sure that Mahinda Rajapaksa will not contest in the next general elections.
