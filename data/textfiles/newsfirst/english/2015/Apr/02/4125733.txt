Petitions filed over the draft 19th Amendment to the constitution, were taken up once again at the Supreme Court on Thursday.
The petitions are being considered by a three-judge bench, comprising of Chief Justice K. Sripavan and Justices Chandra Ekanayake and Priyasad Depp.
While some of the petitioners argue, that passage of the amendment will require a public referendum, others submit that a two thirds majority in parliament, will suffice.
Several factions made submissions to court on the matter today .
The court will reconvene on Monday, where the bench has allotted one hour for the Attorney General to make submissions.
The Supreme Court noted that they would present their determination to the President, as soon as possible.
