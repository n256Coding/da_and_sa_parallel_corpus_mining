MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara, the Leader of the Democratic Left Front, says that the Prime Minister as the appointing authority, must take responsibility for the alleged treasury bond scam, and make a statement himself.
Speaking to News1st, Nanayakkara reiterated that the government cannot delay taking action on the matter, as the countryâ€™s reputation is at stake.
MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara went onto note that the Prime Minister who hand- picked Arjuna Mahendran has to take responsibility and cannot just brush over it and say that this is a technical matter.
Speaking further, he added that he would go to the extent of saying that PM must make a statement about this and his relationship to Arjuna Mahendran, to hand-pick him to be the Governor of the Central Bank.
