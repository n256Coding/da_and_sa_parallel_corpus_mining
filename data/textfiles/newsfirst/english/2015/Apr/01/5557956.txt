Minister Rajitha Senaratne revealed at a media briefing on Wednesday that the Colombo Outer Ring Road Project, is being undertaken at Rs.
30 billion less than the initial estimate.
Cabinet Spokesperson Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne stated that reducing the cost by 30 billion on a single project conveys  the  scale of corruption that prevailed in Sri Lanka.
Dr. Senaratne said: They have increased the amount in large quantities for kilometre by kilometre which I pointed out in the run-up to the election.
Nowhere in the world have they spent so much per kilometer.
