A protest was staged in Kumbukkana, Moneragala on Wednesday, April 1, over  the termination of a group of volunteer teachers who were serving at the Welassa Subhagya College.
This school has been established for children with visual, hearing impairments and those with special needs.
There are 55 students present in the school and education is provided until O/L.
As four volunteer teachers were removed from this school, parents rallied demanding that they be  reinstated.
During the demonstration, former minister Sumedha G. Jayasena arrived at the scene.
