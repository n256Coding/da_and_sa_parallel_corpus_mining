Today marks Bak Full Moon Poya Day, which also marks Lord Buddhaâ€™s second visit to Sri Lanka.
Bak Full Moon Poya Day is of great significance to Buddhist devotees in Sri Lanka.
Five years after attaining enlightenment, the Lord Buddha undertook his second visit to Sri Lanka.
The purpose of this visit was to advise the kings Chulodara and Mahodara who were preparing to wage war.
The history of the Sasana notes that the Lord Buddha, on reaching Nagadeepa, preached to the Naga tribe and made them understand the value of peace and averting war between the two kings.
