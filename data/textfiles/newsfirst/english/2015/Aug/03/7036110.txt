Speaking at a media briefing convened at the UPFA Party Headquarters in Colombo on Monday August 3, Professor Rajiva Wijesinghe says that the process the government had followed to obtain a loan from the Chinese Exim Bank, lacks transparency.
He said: He saved about 30 billion But he did not save that money.
He promptly gave a new contract to the same company on an unsolicited bid.
Even though there is a cabinet paper saying – no don’t take unsolicited bids – and that company was given a contract claiming , the sub-committee says that the Chinese Exim Bank has “promised” to fund this.
He also stated: External resources sends a letter saying, give us the document so that we can start the asking process.
So the cabinet is being deceived.
Speaking further he noted that all this is done in the weeks after the parliament was dissolved adding that it is very clear that there is no transparency, there is no accountability.
Speaking to News1st, a representative of the Chinese Exim Bank, said that the loan for the Central Highway had in fact not been approved by the Exim bank.
