On Monday August 3, President Maithripala Sirisena engaged in an inspection tour of the Moragahakanda Water Project.
President Sirisena looked into the progress of the project and instructed the project director and the staff to complete the work within the stipulated period.
The foundation stone for this project, the biggest multi-functional irrigation project, was laid by President Sirisena in 2007, when he was the Minister of Agricultural Development and Agrarian Services Development.
The construction work on the project, which is being handled by local engineers, is expected to be completed by 2016.
