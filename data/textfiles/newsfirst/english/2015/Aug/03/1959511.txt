Two public meetings of the UPFA were scheduled to be held under the patronage of UPFA Kurunegala District Candidate Mahinda Rajapaksa in Kurunegala on Sunday August 02.
However, according to our correspondent, one meeting had to be cancelled.
A meeting between UPFA Kurunegala District Candidate Mahinda Rajapaksa and the Kurunegala Three-wheeler Drivers’ Association was to be held in an open air theatre belonging to the Urban Council.
Another meeting was organised by the Kurunegala District Youth at the Kurunegala Urban Council auditorium.
While a group was seen gathered at the premises where the meeting with three-wheeler drivers was to take place, a registration table was established in the vicinity.
However, moments later an announcement was made informing the group to join the meeting which was organised for the youth.
Thereby the three wheel drivers took part in this meeting where Mahinda Rajapaksa too was in attendance.
