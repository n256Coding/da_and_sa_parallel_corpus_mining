With the general election a little over two weeks away, multiple views were expressed by political party leaders on the election stage.
Prime Miniser Ranil Wickremesinghe gave his share of views stating that a system which will be based on consensus will be brought in in order to allow parties to join in governing the country by making proposals and also by overlooking the governmentâ€™s operations by chairing the select committee in Parliament.
Speaking at a separate meeting, the UPFA Kurunegala district candidate and former president Mahinda Rajapaksa stated that his aspiration is to recommence the stalled development.
He added that Rs.
380 or more will be introduced for rubber, Rs.
50 for paddy and Rs.
70 for milk.
