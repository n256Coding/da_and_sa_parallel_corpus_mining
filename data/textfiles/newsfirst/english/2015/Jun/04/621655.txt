In a sign that the market for wearable devices remains nascent, China’s Xiaomi has risen from nowhere to become the industry’s second largest company responsible for one-quarter of all shipments in the first quarter of this year.
That’s according to new data from IDC, which ranks Fitbit top of the tree with 3.9 million shipments in Q1 2015, that’s more than double its previous year and 34.2 percent of the current market.
Xiaomi came in next with 2.8 million shipments — 24.6 of the market — ahead of Garmin (6.1 percent), Samsung (5.1 percent) and Jawbone (4.4 percent).
IDC noted that Pebble and Sony narrowly missed out on featuring in the top five.
