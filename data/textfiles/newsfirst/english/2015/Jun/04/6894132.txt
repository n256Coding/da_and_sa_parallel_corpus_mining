Discussions are being held at present regarding several no-confidence motions.
What is a no-confidence motion?
Who can it apply to?
These queries were posed to Attorney-at-Law Chrishmal Warnasuriya.
Attorney-at-Law Chrishmal Warnasuriya stated that if a simple majority in parliament votes to the effect that there is no confidence, then the Speaker will make a statement on the vote.
He added that the Article 46 of the Constitution states that when such a no-confidence motion is adopted, the President has the prerogative of removing the said Minister or the Prime Minister, from his position.
