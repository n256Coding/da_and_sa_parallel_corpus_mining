A suspect in Puttalam who was arrested while hiding in the woods, after abducting an eight year old, has been placed under remand custody.
The child who fell victim to this suspect had not arrived in the three-wheeler which takes her home after school.
It is learnt that this individual had tricked the girl and had taken her into woods.
However, the quick intervention of the locals had prevented what could have been the most traumatic event the girl would have faced in her life.
Meanwhile, a child aged one year and eight months, who had  freed herself from her parents’ attention, died after falling into a canal near her house in Sooriyawewa.
She had met with this tragedy while both her parents were at home on Tuesday morning.
As her parents are government servants, she had been under the care of her grandmother.
However, on this day, the grandmother had gone to the temple.
