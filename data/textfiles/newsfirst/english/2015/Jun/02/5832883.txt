Square Enix and Crystal Dynamics have debuted the new cinematic trailer for Rise of the Tomb Raider .
The trailer features the voiceover of Camilla Luddington (“ Grey’s Anatomy ”), who also provided the voice and motion capture for Lara Croft for the 2013 video game Tomb Raider.
Rise of the Tomb Raider continues the story of Lara Croft as she seeks to learn more about the deeper, secret world she has discovered around her.
Obsessed by what she has seen, Lara is now threatened by a shadow organization intent on killing her for what she knows.
She is pushed to her physical and mental limits as she seeks the truth buried deep within the tombs of an ancient world.
To unravel the mystery of a Lost City, Lara must use her survival skills and wits, learn to trust new friends, and ultimately accept her destiny as the Tomb Raider.
Rise of the Tomb Raider will be released as a timed-exclusive for the Xbox One and Xbox 360 later this year.
