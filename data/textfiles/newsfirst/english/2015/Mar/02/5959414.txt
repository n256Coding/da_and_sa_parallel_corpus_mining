President Maithripala Sirisena says that the approach adopted by world power houses to invade smaller countries, has changed.
The President made this statement at the commemoration ceremony of Venerable Wariyapola Sumangala Thero.
The memorial of Venerable Wariyapola Sumangala Thero was ceremoniously held at the Sri Sumangala Temple in Wariyapola on Monday.
Two hundred (200) years ago, that is in the year 1815, on a day like today, the British took over the rule of this country following an agreement signed in Kandy.
Venerable Sri Sumangala Thero is known for taking down the union jack and re-hoisting the Sinhalese national flag before the convention that handed over control of the country to the British in 1815.
The struggle for independence commenced subsequently and came to an end on  February 4, 1948 – giving Sri Lanka full independence from the British.
