Residents of Pannipitiya say they are being inconvenienced as a result of vehicles arriving at the Dewram Vehera Viharaya, parking on the road.
Residents say that since the road is very narrow, it is blocked whenever buses and heavy vehicles travel on it.
CCTV footage, shows the situation residents had to face, when they attempted to inform authorities regarding the use of this by-road, when there is a main road that leads to the Viharaya.
On February 26, a group including the Chief Incumbent at the Viharaya, had threatened one of the people who took the initiative in this demonstration.
