The world No.
1 beat sixth-seed Andy Murray 7-6 (5) 6-7 (4) 6-3 6-0 in a nearly four-hour contest in Melbourne to become just the second man to claim five Australian Open titles.
Djokovic collected his eighth grand slam title overall to join among others Murray’s former coach, Ivan Lendl.
Murray, meanwhile, lost his fourth Australian Open final.
The first two sets lasted more than two-and-a-half hours but once Djokovic saved a break point in the middle of the third set he didn’t drop another game.
The final was briefly interrupted by two protestors who ran onto Rod Laver Arena in the second set, a break that helped the Scot rally in the set.
Like Saturday’s women’s winner, Serena Williams, Djokovic has never been beaten past the quarterfinals at Melbourne Park.
