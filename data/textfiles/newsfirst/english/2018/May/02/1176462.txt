REUTERS – A hit play from the “Harry Potter” franchise joined an acclaimed revival of AIDS drama “Angels in America” to dominate Broadway’s Tony award nominations yesterday (May 1).
Glenda Jackson and Denzel Washington were nominated for acting Tonys, while “Mean Girls” and “SpongeBob SquarePants: The Musical” scored the most nominations with 12 each, including for best musical.
“Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,” a new play about the grown wizard and his troubled relationship with his teen-aged son, won 10 nominations, including best play and best actor for star Jamie Parker.
The more than five-hour, two-part saga earned raves on Broadway after winning record Olivier awards in London last year (2017).
Another monumental two-part drama, a revival of “Angels in America,” took 11 nominations, including best play revival, best actor Andrew Garfield and best-featured actor for Nathan Lane as closeted conservative firebrand Roy Cohn.
