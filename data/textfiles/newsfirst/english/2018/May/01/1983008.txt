A 26-storey building collapsed after being engulfed in flames in Brazil’s largest city, São Paulo, killing at least one person.
Firefighters continue to search for survivors through the burning rubble.
A firefighter told Globo TV that they expected to find victims but did not know how many.
The fire had begun at around 1:30 a.m. local time, according to a Sao Paulo Fire Department spokesman.
Witnesses said flames spread quickly from one of the lower floors and set an adjacent building on fire.
