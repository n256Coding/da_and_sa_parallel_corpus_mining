US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says a landmark nuclear deal with Iran was “built on lies”, after Israel claimed to have proof of a secret Iranian nuclear weapons programme.
Pompeo said documents revealed by Israel’s prime minister were authentic.
Analysts say they show nothing new, highlighting that concerns over Iran’s nuclear ambitions led to the 2015 deal.
US President Donald Trump, who opposes the accord, has until May 12th to decide whether to abandon it or not.
Other Western powers, including signatories Britain and France, say Iran has been abiding by the deal and it should be kept.
