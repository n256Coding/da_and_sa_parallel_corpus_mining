The European Space Agency and the China Manned Space Engineering Office sources confirm, the Chinese space lab Tiangong-1 will re-enter the earth’s atmosphere within next 24 hours.
China launched the Tiangong-1 space lab in September 2011 as a part of their space programme.
Chinese authorities informed United Nations in 2017, that Tiangong-1 has stopped functioning in March 2016.
The Chinese administration did not give a reason for the failure of the space lab.
The space lab is currently orbiting the earth at a height of 196.4 kilometers (122 miles).
According to the scientists, the structure of the Tiangong-1 will burn up as it re-enters into the earth’s atmosphere, therefore the danger of being hit by falling debris is one in a trillion.
The China Manned Space Engineering Office confirms the Tiangong-1 will not crash however the debris will fall in form of a shower of meteors.
