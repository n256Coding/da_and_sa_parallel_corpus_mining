COLOMBO (News 1st) – A spokesperson for the Ministry of National Policy and Economic Affairs said on the 20th of August, 4053 graduates will be recruited for training in the public sector as per the cabinet approval.
Additional Secretary of the Ministry Asanka Dayaratne noted that these individuals have graduated from internal universities in Sri Lanka.
Under this initiative, another 15,000 will be recruited for training in the public sector before the year-end.
The Additional Secretariat added that these recruits will be made permanent employees in government agencies at the end of the one year training period.
However, the Unemployed Graduates’ Union has shown their disagreement with regard to the decision as it prioritizes the internal graduates.
