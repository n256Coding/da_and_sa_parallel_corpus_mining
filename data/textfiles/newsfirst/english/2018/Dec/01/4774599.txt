Colombo (News1st): Leader of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna G.L.
Peiris speaking at a press conference held at his residence said that Speaker Karu Jayasuriya is working according to his own agenda.
He noted that the streets of Colombo are full of posters hailing him as the greatest hero since King Dutugemunu.
G.L.
Peiris said that the speaker has been acting in an illegal manner and now it seems that he has falsified the official government documents.
He went on to note that the hanzard approved by him contains a sentence that is not there in the video which is a contemporaneous record of parliamentary proceedings prepared by none other than the officials of the parliament.
He added that it is the best possible evidence of what transpired in parliament on a particular occasion and there is a discrepancy between that and the version of hanzard approved by the speaker.
