Colombo (News1st): JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake has called on the President to immediately withdraw the Gazette on the dissolution of Parliament.
He noted that the president must take up the task of handing over government to the group that commands a majority in Parliament.
“We will not allow this issue to be solved with Ranil Wickremesinghe and Mahinda Rajapaksa meeting in the Parliament Library and having their arms over each other’s shoulder,” said MP Dissanayake.
He stated that all responsible for this state conspiracy should be penalized and held accountable.
