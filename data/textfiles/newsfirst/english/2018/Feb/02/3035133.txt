John Amaratunga today (February 2) denied the viral photo of a naked man standing in what looked like a bathroom, was him.
He repeatedly refused to accept the person in the image was in fact him, despite the startling resemblance.
Amaratunga went on to note that nobody can claim it was him as his name wasnâ€™t on the image.
