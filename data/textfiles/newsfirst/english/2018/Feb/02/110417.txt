Residents of the Kondagalawatta village in Galle are making an appeal for the reconstruction of a bridge which has fallen into a dangerous state of disrepair.
This bridge is being used by around 350 villagers travelling between the villages of Udugama and Nagoda in Kondagalawatta.
Villagers claim the bridge that was constructed to cross the Kambipalama lake has not been maintained for a long time and and has now become dangerous to the villagers.
The foundation to construct a new bridge has been laid two and half years ago.
However construction stopped shortly after it was began.
School children in the area are also at risk.
A request is made by the villagers to the authority to take measures to reconstruct the bridge.
