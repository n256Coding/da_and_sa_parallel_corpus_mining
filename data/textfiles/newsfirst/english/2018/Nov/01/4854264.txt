Reuters: Colombian students donned their Halloween best to march on the streets of Bogota on Wednesday (October 31) to demand more education funding.
The student protest is the latest protest calling on the government to increase investment in education and adjust the salary strata for teachers to guarantee better quality.
The student Halloween protest follows similar marches by teachers that have culminated in strike action.
The Colombian government has denied it isnâ€™t appropriately funding education, saying that it is in compliance with a programme that keeps funding linked to an education point system.
Students say the funding formula needs to be re-worked.
