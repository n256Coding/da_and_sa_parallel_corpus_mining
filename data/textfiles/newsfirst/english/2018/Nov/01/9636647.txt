Reuters: A judge on Wednesday (October 31) ordered Peru’s opposition leader, Keiko Fujimori, back to jail pending a trial over allegations she used her conservative party to launder money for Brazilian construction company Odebrecht.
The daughter of former President Alberto Fujimori and a twice-defeated presidential candidate, Fujimori has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and described the prosecution’s efforts to imprison her to keep her from fleeing “political persecution.” Fujimori, 43, spent a week in police custody earlier this month before being released on appeal.
