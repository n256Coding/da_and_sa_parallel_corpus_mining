Colombo (News 1st) – UPFA MP Wimal Weerawanse expressed his views about the temple trees in a media briefing held at the Prime Minister’s office today (November 02).
MP Weerawanse stated that ‘MP Ranil Wickremesinghe’ is inside the temple trees and has self-imposed house arrest.
He then states that ‘former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe’ would now be the latest example of a person who is under house arrest by himself.
Weerawanse goes on to state that if Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa was able to provide subsidies for the public within 24 hours of being appointed the finance minister that depicts that the previous government had burdened the people when there was a chance for them to the provide relief.
He concludes stating ‘The curse was with Wickremesinghe.’
