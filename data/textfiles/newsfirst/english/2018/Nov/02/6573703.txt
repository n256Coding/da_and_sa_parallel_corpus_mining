Colombo (News1st): MP Sagala Rathnayaka states all government officials must respect the law and constitution of the country, and deliberate violation of the law is a punishable offence.
Issuing a release Sagala Ratnayake notes orders given out by officials who were appointed illegally, does not have a legality.
He stressed once the present crisis is resolved legal action will be taken against such individuals.
He went onto note that not only the UNP but all other political parties should come to an agreement that the crisis needs to be solved in Parliament.
