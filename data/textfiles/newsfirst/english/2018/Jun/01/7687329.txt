REUTERS : Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy was seen leaving a restaurant in Madrid on Thursday (May 31) where he met with members of his cabinet following a no-confidence debate in the Parliament.
Rajoy left the parliament before the session ended and was believed to have met with members of his government to discuss the possible outcome of the no-confidence vote he is facing.
Pedro Sanchez was almost certain to become Spain’s new Prime Minister after his socialist party on Thursday secured enough votes to topple Mariano Rajoy in a confidence vote over a corruption case.
The vote is due to take place on Friday (May 31).
However, Rajoy will not resign ahead of the no-confidence vote according to the Secretary-General of his People’s Party (PP), Maria Dolores de Cospedal.
