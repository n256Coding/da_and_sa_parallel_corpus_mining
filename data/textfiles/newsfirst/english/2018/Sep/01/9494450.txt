Colombo (News 1st) â€“ Saturday (Sep 1st) marked day five of the Gammadda Door to Door Initiative.
With the support of the Peradeniya University, the teams have been travelling in several districts identifying the problems faced by the general public.
Our journey into a number of areas in Hambantota revealed that many of the smaller villages that have been forgotten by most constantly have to face the dangers of wild elephants.
The pachyderms are responsible for destroying acres or farmland, parents in the area are also considering not sending their children to school because of the risk posed by the wild elephants.
Residents of Gonagala and a number of other villages in the Kurunegala district revealed to the gammadda teams that the primary issue they face is the lack of a proper road network to travel into the towns to access basic healthcare facilities as well as education.
Several villages also faced hardships in securing clean drinking water.
