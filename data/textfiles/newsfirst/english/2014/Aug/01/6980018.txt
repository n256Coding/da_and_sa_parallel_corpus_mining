A group of street vendors staged a protest in Anuradhapura on August 1.
The vendors were protesting the removal of their businesses in line with a ruling of the Municipal Council.
The demonstration was held to protest the removal of street vendors on the stretch of pavement from the Ayurveda Roundabout in Anuradhapura up until the General Hospital.
One of the protesters ascended a tree to show his protest.
Our reporter says that Minister of Education Services Duminda Dissanayake had visited the scene of the protest in the evening.
The protester who climbed the tree later descended on the promise that street vendors would be granted talks with the Mayor of Anuradhapura on August 2.
