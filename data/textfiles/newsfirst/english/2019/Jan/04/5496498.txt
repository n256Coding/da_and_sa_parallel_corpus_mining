Colombo (News1st): A group of Sri Lankan employees working on the Kalu river project in Laggala have launched a strike.
The employees are attached to a Chinese sub-contractor company handling the project.
Close to 150 employees staged the protest at the site last evening.
This is due to the company slashing all their allowances from the month of January.
The Laggala Police was called to the site of the protest.
Discussions between a company representative and the protesters proved to be futile.
