Colombo (News1st): Doctors at the Welikada Prison Hospital have temporarily withdrawn from their duties.
They took this decision after a senior official in the prison berated a doctor.
They noted that even thoughÂ they have refrained from work they will engage in emergency treatments.
However, the doctors charge that until the official apologizes publicly they will refrain from their duties.
