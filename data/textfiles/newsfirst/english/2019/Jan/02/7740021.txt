Colombo (News1st): A group of people who entered the property of a family in Ganemulla last night (Jan 1) caused extensive damages to it.
The mob had broken into another nearby house and attacked its owner, prior to breaking and entering the second house.
An argument over the damaging of a fence had created a rift between two groups.
The same group that carried out the attack on Tuesday are also believed to have attacked another house involved in the rift.
One of the victims of the attack stated that an underworld criminal named Kumara Jayakody rammed his car against them and then another person named Chamara tied her husband’s hands and attacked him.
She added that when her husband escaped they attacked their son’s bike and another scooter.
The victim in question was admitted to the Ragama teaching hospital with serious injuries.
