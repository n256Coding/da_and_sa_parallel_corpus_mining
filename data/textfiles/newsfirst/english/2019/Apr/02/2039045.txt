COLOMBO (News 1st) – President Maithripala Sirisena made an explanation as to the alternatives which would be followed after the Grade 5 scholarship exam is suspended at an event at Subharathi Mahamathya Maha Vidyalaya to vest a hall and a three-storied building with students.
The president noted that the government would not make an ad-hoc decision to suspend the Grade 5 scholarship exam immediately.
He said that once the Grade 5 scholarship exam is suspended, an alternative exam would replace it in Grade 7 or 8 and then, based on the results obtained, students will be allowed to pursue their education on a specific field of study.
