Reuters: Pro and anti-Brexit parties caused a stir with their antics at the European Parliament plenary session on Tuesday (July 2), the first since May’s European election.
Several MEPs from the UK’s Liberal Democrat party attended the session wearing yellow t-shirts marked with the words “Stop Brexit,” and their European election campaign slogan, “Bollocks to Brexit.” On the other end of the political spectrum, Brexit Party members, who are pushing for the UK’s departure from the European Union, turned their backs on musicians as they played the bloc’s anthem, “Ode to Joy.” The two parties were the most successful British parties in the European elections, with the Liberal Democrats winning 15 seats, whilst the Brexit Party claimed first place in the UK with 29 seats just months after it was created.
