COLOMBO (News 1st) – Petroleum Trade Unions have announced that they will suspend their strike and resume renovation work on the old pipeline that transports fuel to the Kolonnawa Petroleum Terminal.
Treasurer of the Ceypetco Executive Officers Union, Manu Jayawardena speaking to News1st expressed hope that external parties will not attempt to interfere in the renovation work.
The re-laying of pipes that transport fuel from the Colombo port to Kolonnawa began recently, work on the new pipe system came to a halt with just 140m to be laid.
Work on the pipeline was interrupted by Minister Ravi Karunanayake and a group of supporters who claimed that the residents surrounding the pipeline were not compensated.
This gave rise to tensions between the CPC and the CEB as well.
