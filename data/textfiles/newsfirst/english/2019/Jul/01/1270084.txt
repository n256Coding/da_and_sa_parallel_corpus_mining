Colombo (News 1st): Petroleum trade unions said that they will supply fuel to the Electricity Board until this Friday (July 5).
The trade unions noted that the decision was reached following discussions.
The trade unions suspended the supply of fuel to the Electricity Board yesterday alleging that Minister Ravi Karunanayake is obstructing the process of renovating the supply line from the Colombo Port to Kolonnawa.
