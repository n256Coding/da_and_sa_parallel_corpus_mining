COLOMBO (News 1st): The license of the quarry operated in Walapane, close to the site where three people died following a landslide, has been temporarily suspended.
Senior Director of the Geological Survey and Mines Bureau, Engineer Sajjana De Silva said that an investigation is underway into the site.
He noted that following the investigation, a decision will be taken as to whether the quarry license will be returned or not.
Meanwhile, the Army says that they are continuing search operations to locate a missing child who was in the house that was buried in the landslide in Walapane.
Army Media Spokesperson Major General Sumith Atapattu said that more than 50 Army personnel have been deployed for this purpose.
A group of residents protested yesterday (December 3) blocking the Kandy main road from the Naranthalawa junction demanding that the permit issued to the quarry be revoked.
