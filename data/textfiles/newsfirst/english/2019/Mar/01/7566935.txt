India is waiting for the release of Wing Commander Abhinandan who was in Pakistani custody since he was shot down over Kashmir on Wednesday (Feb 27), a goodwill gesture which could defuse the gravest crisis in the disputed border region in years.
Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan announced that the pilot, whose jet was downed during a dogfight between Pakistani and Indian warplanes, would be released today (March 1) as a “gesture for peace.” Officers and media have gathered on both sides of the Wagah border, ahead of the imminent release of the captured Indian pilot.
