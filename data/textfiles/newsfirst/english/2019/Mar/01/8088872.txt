REUTERS – Asian shares inched higher on Friday (March 1) with broader gains capped by investor caution as concerns about China’s economy and global trade weighed on sentiment while stronger-than-expected U.S. GDP data pushed the dollar up.
MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up less than 0.1 percent in early trade.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 gained 0.8 percent, helped by the weaker yen.
Investors will be looking to the opening of Chinese markets after the benchmark Shanghai Composite index posted its strongest monthly gain in nearly four years in February.
South Korea’s financial markets are closed Friday for a public holiday.
