Fourteen people were killed and 19 wounded when a bus carrying students ran over an improvised explosive device in northern Burkina Faso.
It was not immediately clear who was responsible for the blast, which hit one bus in a convoy of three that was carrying 160 passengers in all.
The incident occurred in Sourou province, near the border with Burkinaâ€™s chaotic neighbour Mali, where Islamist groups with links to al Qaeda and Islamic State have increased attacks over the past two years despite international efforts to stamp them out.
