U.S. President Donald Trump said that Phase 1 of an American trade deal with China would be signed on Jan. 15 at the White House.
The president wrote in a tweet that he would sign the deal with “high level representatives of China” and that he would later travel to Beijing to begin talks on the next phase.
The deal on the first phase was struck in December.
