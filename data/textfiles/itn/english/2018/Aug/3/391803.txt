According to the electoral commission President Emmerson Mnangagwa has won Zimbabweâ€™s presidential election.
With all 10 provinces declared, Mnangagwa won 50.8% of votes, compared to 44.3% for opposition leader Nelson Chamisa.
Police removed opposition officials from the electoral commission stage when they rejected the results.
By narrowly winning more than 50% of the vote, Mnangagwa avoids a run-off election against Chamisa.
Mnangagwa, from the governing Zanu-PF party, took over as president last November from long-serving leader Robert Mugabe.
