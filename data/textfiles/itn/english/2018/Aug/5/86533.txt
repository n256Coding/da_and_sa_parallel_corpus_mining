At least 18 people were killed and 33 injured in a collision between a passenger bus and a tanker in northwest Pakistan.
The bus was travelling from Buner to Karachi, and the accident occurred near the Samari area of Kohat district.
The cause of the accident was not immediately known.
The injured passengers were taken to the district hospital after rescue workers rushed to the crash site.
Road accidents are common in rural Pakistan, where roads are in poor conditions and drivers generally ignore the rules.
