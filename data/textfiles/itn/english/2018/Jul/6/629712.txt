British fashion brand Ralph and Russo unveiled its eighties-inspired autumn/winter 2018/2019 collection during a neon-lit fashion show in Paris.
Flashy colour blocking, glitter and volume were reminiscent of style in the early part of the decade and designer Tamara Ralph said she wanted to celebrate the strength of the era, taking her inspiration from French fashion icon Jacqueline de Ribes.
The label’s creations have been worn in recent years by British royals including the Duchess of Cambridge and her sister-in-law Meghan Markle.
