North Korea conducted another test of its super-large multiple rocket launchers successfully.
The test’s success was immediately reported, and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un “expressed satisfaction” and congratulated the scientists who had developed the weapon.
KCNA released a photo of the multiple rocket launcher, surrounded by yellow flames and smoke.
Thursday’s test verified that the “continuous fire system” of the multiple rocket launchers is able to “totally destroy” a group target of the enemy by a surprise strike.
