Nigerian fire-fighters battled a blaze which ripped through a popular local market in Nigeria’s commercial capital of Lagos.
General Manager of the Lagos Fire Department, Oluwafemi Oke-Osanyintolu said the proximity of the shops in the market inhibited the fire service’s ability to tackle the fire.
No deaths have been reported but many properties were damaged, the cause of the fire is yet unknown.
