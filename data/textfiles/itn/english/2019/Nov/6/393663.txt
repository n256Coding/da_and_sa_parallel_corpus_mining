Iran will begin injecting uranium gas into centrifuges at its Fordow nuclear facility today.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said the gas will be injected into 1,044 of its centrifuges at the plant, counter to stipulations in the 2015 nuclear treaty.
But these steps can be reversed, he added, as long as other signatories to the international agreement uphold their commitments.
Russia and France, both signatories on the 2015 deal, have since expressed concern over the latest action.
