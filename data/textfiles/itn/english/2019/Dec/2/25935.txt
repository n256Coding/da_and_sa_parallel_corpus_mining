At least 24 Tunisians were killed after a bus crashed during an excursion in the northern town of Amdoun.
The bus veered off a winding road when the driver failed to negotiate a sharp turn and crashed to the bottom of a ravine.
The bus was carrying 43 people.
President Kais Saied and Prime Minister Youssef Chahed attended the crash site in the northwestern region of Tunisia, which attracts large numbers of visitors but has poor infrastructure.
