Formula One star Lewis Hamilton described his emotions as being “above cloud nine” as he jetted in from Abu Dhabi for the 2019 British Fashion Awards on Monday (December 2).
Fresh off of winning the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on Sunday (December 1) to cap off another stellar season which saw the Brit win 11 races en route to a sixth championship title, Hamilton added he felt brand new and was grateful to have experienced such a dominant season.
