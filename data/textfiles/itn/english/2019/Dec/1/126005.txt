Luna Fenner, an American toddler battling a rare skin condition that appears as a dark mask-like patch around her face, made a public appearance in Russia’s southern city of Krasnodar following her first round of treatment.
Eight-month-old Luna took part in a news conference alongside her mother Carol Fenner and Russian doctor Pavel Popov, who specialises in skin disorders.
During the first course of treatment, Luna underwent a series of procedures to remove a congenital melanocytic nevus from her forehead and the edges of her eyelids.
The condition causes abnormally dark blemishes and is associated with higher risks of developing skin cancer.
