Sustainable collections hit the catwalk as Berlin Fashion Week hosted a new wave of labels hoping to cash in on consumer demand for ethical clothing and to bring the industry in line with a growing movement away from mass production.
Neonyt, a hybrid of the Greek and Swedish words for new, took to the stage at Berlin’s Ewerk with a multi-brand curated show of sustainable clothing brands, showing that eco-friendly clothes need not be dull.
Denim, a wardrobe staple, has also had an eco makeover in the form of Mud Jeans, whose founder Bert van Son is planning to make the product 100 percent recycled by 2020.
