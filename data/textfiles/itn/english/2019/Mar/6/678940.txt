At least 16 people were killed in a suicide attack early on a construction company in eastern Afghanistan, Â the latest bloody assault in the war-torn country.
The hours-long assault in Jalalabad began early this evening when at least two blasts were heard, before security forces rushed to the scene in the city, which is the capital of Nangarhar province.
Sixteen employees of the company have been killed and nine more injured.
A second official said there had been casualties but could not immediately verify the toll.
All five attackers have been killed by security forces.
He said a clearance operation was ongoing with security defusing two suicide vests, one car bomb, and multiple mines planted by the attackers.
